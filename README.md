# Java Game Thing
*This is a work-in-progress and probably will be for a hot minute... Take this repository with a grain of salt.*
## Purpose
This "game thing" is an attempt of mine to keep my skills sharp by making a game without the use of a game engine. The artwork will be terrible, the animations will be clunky, and fun will probably not be had for years. I plan on periodically updating this while between jobs and interviews and will likely continue my work (although to a lesser extent) upon landing a job.

## TODO List
- [X] Create Hero Sprite
- [X] Start Animations
- [X] Handle Turning Around *This is tenative. I still need to handle changes mid-change.*
- [ ] Create Jumping Animation
- [ ] Handle Gravity
- [ ] Handle Pausing (more gracefully)
- [ ] Handle Loading
- [ ] Everything Else.......

### Side Notes
All animations are done in Aseprite and are handmade by yours truely. If, for some reason, you want to use them, feel free. They are awful and I am definitely not a graphic artist.
Speaking of animations, they are specifically named, if for some reason someone wishes to contribute. More information on this is described in the AnimatedObject class located in the abstractions folder.
If you are a fellow programmer who wants to join in the fun of working collaboratively on a game that currently has no definitive direction (other than being 2D), please email me at davidmmills@hotmail.com.
And yes, hotmail is still a thing. If you want an alternative email address you can send me an email at idonthaveanother@aol.com.
That was a joke.
